# SRP (The Single-Responsibility Principle): 'A class should have only one reason to change'
	An axis of change is an axis of change only if the changes actually occur.

# OCP (The Open-Closed Principle): 'Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.' 
	Open for extension & Closed for modification ==> Abstraction is the key
	It is changed by adding new code rather than by chaning existing code.
	"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
	Using a "Data-Driven' Approach to Achieve Closure.
	"Resisting premature abstraction is as importance as abstraction itself."

#LSP (The Liskov Substitution Principle): 'Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types'
	A violation of LSP is a latent violation of OCP.
	A design is self-consistent is not necessarily consistent with all its users!
	--The author of g assumed that changing the width of a Rectangle leaves its height unchanged.--
	A model, viewed in isolation, can not be meaningfully validated.
	The LSP makes it clear that in OOD, the IS-A relationship pertains to behavior that can be reasonably assumed and that clients depend on.
	DBC: Design by Contract --> A routine redeclaration [in a derivative] may only replace the original precondition by one equal or weaker, and the original postcondition by one equal or stronger.

#DIP (Dependency-Inversion Principle)
	a. "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."
	b. "Abstraction shoud not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."
	# Depend on Abstractions
		No variable should hold a pointer or reference to a concrete class.
		No class should derive from concrete class.
		No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.
	Dependency-Inversion can be applied wherever one class sends a message to another.
		Ex: Button object and the Lamp object
		
#ISP (The interface-segregation principle)
	Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
