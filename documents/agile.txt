# SRP (The Single-Responsibility Principle): 'A class should have only one reason to change'
	An axis of change is an axis of change only if the changes actually occur.

# OCP (The Open-Closed Principle): 'Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.' 
	Open for extension & Closed for modification ==> Abstraction is the key
	It is changed by adding new code rather than by chaning existing code.
	"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
	Using a "Data-Driven' Approach to Achieve Closure.
	"Resisting premature abstraction is as importance as abstraction itself."
